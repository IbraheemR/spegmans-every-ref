Glass chemistry is a complex subject, and as such the following descriptions are merely a guide based on descriptions and photos. Colours can vary wildly depending on conditions of manufacture, contamination and even heating/cooling of the glass.

It is also worth noting that there are a few mechanisms by which these metals give glass colour. Some ions are simple doping of the glass, as is the case with many modern glass colors, while some are colloidal particles, such as red gold glass. Some colours are brought about by simple absorption, while others are from light scattering, producing colours unrelated to the metal's absorption spectra.

Many more great photos can be seen in the smart-elements.com [catalogue](https://www.smart-elements.com/wp/category/glassbeads/).
